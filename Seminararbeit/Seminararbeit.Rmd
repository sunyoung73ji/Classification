# Rmarkdown Template

Currently there is one thing you need to customise manually in *template.tex* which will be used by the \LaTeX processor for generating the PDF: the entries in the columns on the title page containing student info. Here you have to replace the dummy data:

```
\begin{multicols}{$cols_authors$}

Name:

Matriculation No.:

E-Mail:

Study Path:

Semester:

Graduation (est.):
```

If you are just two people, working alone or want to remove the colum design you may delete (parts of) this section.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You may use \LaTeX\ to write formulas, e.g., $X^2 = \sqrt{X^4}$ and $$X^2 = \sqrt{X^4}.$$

After clicking the *Knit* button in *RStudio*, a (PDF) document that includes both content and the output of any embedded R code chunks will be generated. 

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:pressure} Pressure", fig.height=4, fig.pos="t"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. You can label the plot above by including the label `\\label{fig:pressure}` in the chunk argument `fig.cap`. A reference to the plot is then made as follows:

Looking at Figure \ref{fig:pressure} makes me happy.

## The YAML Header

The YAML header is at the very top of this document. It is enclosed by 3 dashes. Although some useful options are specified already (most of which are hopefully self-explaining) you may want additional customisation. Below we discuss useful options that we have implemented for you.

*Note that **indentation and line breaks matter** in the YAML header.* More about that [here](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/markdown-yaml-cheat-sheet/#yaml).

### `language`

This variable affects mainly the headings of your output file and automatic hyphenation.

You can set this to `english` or `german` like this:

`language: english`

`language: german`

If the language is not specified in the YAML header it will be set to `english`.


### `linespread`

The default value for the linespread is 1.5. Usually this is fine and sometimes it's required. If you nevertheless want to change it you can do so by specifying the linespread variable, e.g.

`linespread: 1`

# Rmarkdown makes your life easy

## The kable function

In empirical work it's crucial not only to present your results but also to explain your research strategy. This often involves tables presenting data and results. Generating tables by hand using \LaTeX is an option but may be time consuming. However, there is a variety of R packages that automate this. One of them is the `kable` package. It can generate \LaTeX tables from a variety of R Objects.

Example: you are working on an analysis of black cherry trees and want to present $n$ observations to the reader You can do that using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(trees)
n <- 6
knitr::kable(trees[sample(1:nrow(trees),n),], 
             caption = paste(n, "Observations from the trees Dataset"),
             row.names = F,
             col.names = c("Diameter", "Height", "Volume"))
```

Now that we have presented our data it's analysis time! Lets start with a quick call to summary().

## The Stargazer package

Calling summary() in a code chunk will work but this will give you quite an ugly result (just try it for yourself!). When it comes to presenting more structured objects like summaries, model results or for example correlation matrices the stargazer package is well suited.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
stargazer::stargazer(trees, header=FALSE, title = "Summary")
```

Assume we want to evaluate how the height and the volume of a typical cherry tree are related. We are estimating this using OLS to estimate a simple linear model.

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
mod <- lm(Volume ~ Height, data = trees)
stargazer::stargazer(mod, title = "Regression results", header=FALSE)
```

Now that we have our model we can visualize it.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap= "Dataset and regression"}
plot(trees$Volume ~ trees$Height)
abline(mod)
```

By the way: the (\LaTeX) command `\pagebreak` can be used to force a page break.

\pagebreak

## Citations

A *bibtex* bibliography can be used for citations. The bibliography file used in this template is `references.bib` and you find it in the project directory. It is easily edited using *RStudio*

A simple *bibtex* entry looks like this: 

```
@book{
  Hastie2013,
  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {2013},
  title = {The elements of statistical learning},
  author = {Hastie, Trevor and Tibshirani, Robert and Friedman, Jerome H.},
}
```

The first field (`Hastie2013`) is the identifier which allows you to cite a reference.

You can cite a source in Harvard style like this: [@Hastie2013] or @Hastie2013.

A cited source will be automatically added to the reference section at the end of the document.

\pagebreak

# Conclusion \label{chap:conc}

Your conclusion. Note that you may also refer to a specific chapter or section in the document, provided there is a label. We have anchored a label to the section header of the Conclusion. You may reference it as follow: See Chapter \ref{chap:conc}.

This section allows you to reference R packages used in the analysis. Simply include them in `R_packages.bib` as *bibtex* entries and include the identifiers using `\notecite{...}` as shown below.
